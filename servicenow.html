                    <h2>Discover ServiceNow Program</h2>
                    <p>During the summer semester of my freshman year, I jetted off to San Diego, California, to visit
                        ServiceNow's headquarters. ‚òÄÔ∏èüåá This adventure marked my second glimpse into the engineering
                        culture of a Fortune 500 company, and what a deep dive it was!</p>

                    <p>We had the incredible opportunity to engage directly with the brilliant minds behind the Now
                        platform. These interactions offered us invaluable insights into their daily work, collaboration
                        methods, cutting-edge technologies, and the exciting projects they're tackling. The passion and
                        dedication of these engineers were truly inspiring, igniting our own enthusiasm for the field.
                    </p>

                    <p>The highlight of the program was undoubtedly the engineering hackathon. Alongside my talented
                        teammates Thomas Nisterenko, Mohamed Burhan, and Christine Goh, we poured our hearts and minds
                        into the challenge. With the expert mentorship of ServiceNow engineers guiding us, we showcased
                        an app that demonstrated robust data management, top-notch security, sophisticated logic &
                        automation, and an intuitive user experience - all powered by the Now platform. Our hard work
                        paid off spectacularly when we clinched 1st place! ü•á</p>

                    <p>But it wasn't all work and no play. San Diego offered plenty of opportunities for adventure
                        beyond the professional realm. I got to explore the world-famous San Diego Zoo, marveling at its
                        diverse inhabitants. And what better way to cap off the experience than a boat tour of the
                        picturesque San Diego Bay?</p>

                    <p>This program was more than just a learning opportunity; it was a chance to immerse myself in the
                        tech industry, form lasting connections, and push my boundaries. It reaffirmed my passion for
                        engineering and left me eager for what the future holds in this dynamic field.</p>
