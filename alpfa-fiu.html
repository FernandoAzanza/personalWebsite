                    <h2>My Journey with ALPFA FIU</h2>
                    <p>In my second semester of university, I had some friends join the Association of Latino
                        Professionals for America (ALPFA). So I checked it out and totally fell in love with the
                        community. I ended up sticking around, helping to deliver Python projects in their weekly tech
                        group meetings. This was on top of the normal Excel, Tableau, and professional development
                        workshops they were already doing.</p>

                    <p>Things kinda snowballed from there. Soon, I was helping companies like Capital One come in for
                        info sessions, and I even started organizing more of the programming that the Tech Group would
                        deliver to all the ALPFA members. It was pretty cool to see how it all came together.</p>

                    <p>ALPFA FIU is actually the largest chapter in the nation, which is pretty awesome. We're super
                        proud that we sponsor FIU students to go to the ALPFA National Convention every year. It's a big
                        deal for us, and it's great to see our members getting these opportunities.</p>

                    <p>Being part of ALPFA has been a wild ride. I've learned so much, met some amazing people, and
                        gotten to work on projects I never thought I'd be involved in. It's crazy how one decision to
                        check out a club can lead to so much.</p>
