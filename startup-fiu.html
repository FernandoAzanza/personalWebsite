                    <h2>My Journey with StartUP FIU</h2>
                    <p>I started college August 22, 2022, and by August 24, I was already in the StartUP FIU building
                        checking out what cool things were happening there.</p>

                    <p>I found that most of the students were engineering or STEAM majors, conducting research, working
                        on interesting projects, or competing in challenges. I loved the community from day one and kept
                        coming back for all their workshops on human-centered design. The way they taught
                        entrepreneurship was really focused on this approach, and I felt super engaged. I learned how to
                        switch my mind from solution to problem and started thinking more about finding user pain
                        points, how to conduct customer interviews in an unbiased way to actually get real data. 'Cause
                        users might say something but actually need something else, you know?</p>

                    <p>I immersed myself with others in brainstorming and making prototypes. What I liked is that it
                        didn't feel like a class (I actually skipped a few classes to attend their workshops) and I felt
                        I was meeting amazing people and getting practical knowledge.</p>

                    <p>I got lucky enough to have a vacancy open up, and now I'm working there part-time, helping with
                        the programs that once helped me. But I'm actually learning more now that I'm behind the
                        scenes. That means learning more about organizing workshops, conducting marketing, presenting,
                        and all that good stuff.</p>

                    <p>Now every Monday at 3:30, I facilitate a roundtable called Student Idea Circle, where as a
                        "facilitator" I help guide the dialogue between the students, and we all help each other with
                        our projects and startup ideas.</p>

                    <p>Luckily, all those skills, from management to design thinking, are what make a great product
                        manager. At the time, I didn't know it, but now that I've finished my Microsoft internship, I
                        can look back and see how the dots lined up, leading me towards PM.</p>
