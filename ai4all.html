                    <h2>My Journey with AI4ALL</h2>
                    <p>During my second semester as a computer science student in spring 2023, I jumped into this
                        awesome opportunity as a College Pathways Participant in the AI4ALL program.</p>

                    <p>I dove deep into the world of AI, learning about all sorts of cool applications and the
                        nitty-gritty technical stuff. Machine learning, gradient descent, neural networks. But it wasn't
                        just about the tech. We also got into the ethical side of things, looking at the implications of
                        data processing and AI implementation. Thinking about the bigger picture.</p>

                    <p>The highlight was definitely our machine learning project. We were trying to detect fake news
                        using logistic regression, which sounds fancy but was actually super interesting. We used this
                        dataset of labeled news articles (labeled as real or fake) and trained a model to figure out if
                        an article was fake or real. It was like teaching a computer to be a fact-checker!</p>

                    <p>This involved cleaning up the data from <a href="http://kaggle.com/"
                            target="_blank">Kaggle.com</a>, which meant getting rid of punctuation, making everything
                        lowercase, and removing "stopwords" (those are the really common words that don't add much
                        meaning). Then we used a good old TF-IDF vectorization to turn all that text into numbers that
                        the computer could understand.</p>

                    <p>We split our data into training and testing sets, and then we checked how well our model did. It
                        had an accuracy of 0.968! The whole project was eye-opening. We weren't just playing around with
                        code; we were doing real research into how AI could impact the news industry. It showed me how
                        machine learning could actually help fight the spread of fake news.</p>

                    <p>By the end of it all, I had earned my Discover AI Certificate of Completion. But more than that,
                        I came away with a whole new perspective on AI and its potential to make a real difference in
                        the world. It was an exhausting ride, and I loved every minute of it. <br> <br> You can check more on my
