                    <h2>Product Management Exposure</h2>
                    <p>During the summer of my freshman year, I first participated in the Black and Hispanic Product
                        Summit. This was my eye-opening introduction to product management outside of StartUP FIU (the
                        Entrepreneurship Hub where I work). I learned directly from Capital One associates about the
                        kinds of products they're working on, realizing that more than a bank, they're a tech company.

                    <h2>HSI Immersion Program</h2>
                    <p>Shortly after, I interviewed for and participated in the Capital One HSI Immersion program. This
                        has definitely been one of the most exhausting yet rewarding weeks I've had throughout my young
                        college journey. To say the least, over the course of just one week, I found myself deeply
                        immersed in case studies, getting hands-on with financial analysis, product development, and
                        software engineering.</p>
                    <p>I worked with an interdisciplinary team of 9 in developing a credit card product, targeting new
                        and prime credit customers. We implemented customer journey mapping, identifying potential users
                        across diverse customer segments. I managed Scrum backlogs, delegating responsibilities and
                        fostering collaboration to align with project goals. Finally, we successfully pitched the final
                        MVP and case study to Capital One associates, representatives, and stakeholders.</p>
                    <p>But the most remarkable part? The people I met. The opportunity to cross paths with such a
                        diverse and talented group of individuals was priceless. We learned, faced challenges, shared
                        laughter, pitched ideas, created memories, inspired each other, and even danced some salsa
                        together üíÉ.</p>
                    <p>Two things stood out to me during the program:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Curiosity, Collaboration, and Communication. These three C's are essential in our lives and
                            pivotal for success.</li>
                        <li>If you can become someone who effectively brings together people, ideas, and structures,
                            you'll be of great value in the business world because business is fundamentally relational.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                    <h2>Tech Mini-Mester Program</h2>
                    <p>To finish the summer with a gold star, I participated in the Capital One Tech Mini-Mester
                        program. This involved hands-on mentoring by Capital One engineers on Node.js, NPM, Git, and
                        diving deep into the intricacies of JS arrays & objects.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the week, I presented a CLI-Based Inventory Management System, crafted in under 24
                        hours. This project offers streamlined inventory management right from your command line,
                        pairing intuitive commands with efficiency. Perfect for personal inventory or business needs,
                        it's designed to get the job done seamlessly. You can catch its evolution on my GitHub. üõ†Ô∏è</p>
